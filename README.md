# Drug-Effectivity-Prediction
Drug resistance is the biggest barrier in cancer treatment so we want to predict the sensitivity of the drugs.

## Deliverables

Current therapies for Cancer treatment include:
- Radiotherapy
- Chemotherapy
- Targeted therapy
- Immunotherapy

Drug resistance accounts for 90% of treatment failures.

Tumors have various ways to resist drugs.

We want to predict the precise medication for better clinical outcomes.
